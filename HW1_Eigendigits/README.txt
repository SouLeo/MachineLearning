This assignment focuses on eigenvector decomposition of covariance for analysis. This is commonly referred to as Principal Components Analysis (PCA.)

Handwritten images of numbers will be projected to a reduced eigenspace. Training will occur on our supervised set and a K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm will be used to label input images of numbers appropriately.
